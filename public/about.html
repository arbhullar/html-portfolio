<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Arsh, a Computer Science graduate with a genuine passion for science and technlogy. 
Ever since I can remember, I've been fascinated by how things work-whether it's logic behing a line of code or the architecture of cloud systems. 
This curiosity led me to explore the world of technology, where I have found endless opportunitiers to learn, create and solve problems.
</p>

<p>I’m currently diving deeper into web development and cloud technologies,eager to build solutions that are not just functional, but impactful.
    I believe that technology has the power to transform the way we live and work, and I’m excited to be part of that journey.
    When I’m not coding or experimenting with new tech, you can find me exploring new ideas, reading about the latest tech trends, or simply enjoying a good science documentary.</p>
